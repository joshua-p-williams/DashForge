# 🚗 DashForge

DashForge is a modular Raspberry Pi-based platform for vehicle diagnostics, media playback, and embedded automotive experimentation. Inspired by airplane-style black box recorders and built for family road trips, weekend hacking, and future upgrades, this system integrates with your vehicle’s power, AV, and OBDII systems — with room to grow.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- 🔋 Safely power and shut down Raspberry Pi systems with ignition events
- 📊 Provide a real-time dashboard using OBDII and sensor data
- 🎬 Deliver in-car entertainment to rear-seat passengers via RCA
- 📹 Capture dash/rear cam footage and vehicle telemetry (black box style)
- 🌐 Build a flexible in-vehicle LAN for Pi-to-Pi and ESP32 communication
- 🧪 Support custom devices and displays via GPIO, UART, or MQTT
