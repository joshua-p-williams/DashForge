### ðŸ“˜ Quick Summary of Input Protection




# ðŸ”§ Input Protection Module

## âœ… Purpose

This module is your *first line of defense* when working in a 12V automotive environment. It protects sensitive electronics from destructive power events common in cars â€” reverse polarity, voltage spikes, and current surges. It ensures that only clean, correctly-polarized voltage enters your circuit. 

- **Reverse Polarity** (accidental wiring or jumpstarts)
- **Voltage Spikes / Transients** (e.g., load dumps, inductive kicks)
- **Current Surges / Short Circuits** (bad things happening on the other end)
- **Modular Use** (Makes a great reusable power input board to drop into any automotive project)

## ðŸ§® Wiring Notes

- **MOSFET is installed "high-side"** (source to input, drain to output).
- When 12V is applied correctly, gate is pulled lower than source and MOSFET conducts.
- **TVS diode is across input and GND** to clamp transients.
- A **100kÎ© pull-down** on the gate ensures clean turn-on behavior.
- **Fuse is first in line** to cut power on shorts or high draw.

*Gate control is passive â€” when VIN is high, Gate is pulled low and the MOSFET conducts.*
