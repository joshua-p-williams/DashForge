> Optional: connect relay output (NO) to GPIO17 via pull-up/pull-down or opto-isolated circuit for signal integrity.

## Behavior

- When ignition is ON (ACC = 12V), XY-J02 relay closes and provides power to the Pi.
- When ignition is turned OFF, the XY-J02 begins a programmable delay.
- After the delay, the relay opens and power to the Pi is cut.
- The Pi should monitor a GPIO pin connected to ACC (or another GPIO relay circuit) to trigger safe shutdown before power is cut.
- The inline rocker switch allows full manual shutdown by cutting 12V Constant to the relay module.

---
- While the vehicle is ON, the 12V accessory signal keeps the relay triggered, and the Pi receives 5V power through the buck converter.
- GPIO17 (or other selected GPIO) reads HIGH during runtime.
- When the vehicle turns OFF (ACC = 0V):
  - The relay begins its shutdown delay (e.g., 30â€“60 seconds).
  - GPIO17 goes LOW (or loses voltage), triggering the shutdown script.
  - The Pi begins a clean shutdown sequence.
  - Once the delay completes, the relay opens, cutting power to the Pi safely after shutdown.

## Shutdown Script (Python Example)

```python
# shutdown_trigger.py
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import os
import time

SHUTDOWN_PIN = 17

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(SHUTDOWN_PIN, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_UP)

try:
    GPIO.wait_for_edge(SHUTDOWN_PIN, GPIO.FALLING)
    os.system("sudo shutdown -h now")
except:
    pass
finally:
    GPIO.cleanup()
```

- Run at boot using `rc.local`, `cron`, or a `systemd` service.

---

## Notes

- Use fused connections for both 12V Constant and Accessory lines.
- Recommended delay: 30â€“60 seconds for safe Pi shutdown.
- Ensure buck converter supports at least 3A output to power Pi and peripherals reliably.
- Be sure to test shutdown behavior by simulating loss of ACC power before deploying in-vehicle.
- Use pull-up/down resistors or opto-isolation for stability on GPIO signal reads.
- Consider logging shutdown events for diagnostics.
