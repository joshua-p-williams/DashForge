# üîå Power System Wiring

This wiring plan outlines a flexible and expandable **Smart Automotive Power Hub** designed to safely manage power and signaling for Raspberry Pi and other in-vehicle electronics.

The system is built around:
- **12V Constant and Accessory power** from the vehicle
- A **delay-off relay** for clean shutdowns
- One or more **buck converters** to supply regulated 5V power
- **Opto-isolated signal outputs** for GPIO-safe device shutdown triggers
- Optional **reference voltage inputs** (3.3V or 5V) to match logic levels
- Modular **screw terminals** for clean, expandable connections

While originally designed to safely power a Raspberry Pi, this system can now serve multiple devices with coordinated startup/shutdown logic ‚Äî making it ideal for in-car dashboards, black boxes, cameras, microcontrollers, and future modules.

### üßØ Ground Wiring Notes

All components share a common ground. Use a **GND bus bar or terminal block** inside the enclosure to tie together:

- VIN_CONST ground
- VIN_ACC ground
- XY-J02 ground
- Buck converter ground
- Raspberry Pi ground
- Optocoupler emitter sides
- Output grounds

All device outputs (Pi, other device, etc.) should tie into this common ground.

### üõ°Ô∏è PROT_IN (Input Protection Module)

Protects downstream components from reverse polarity, voltage spikes, and overcurrent.  
See [Input Protection Module](./power-input-protection.md) for full details and wiring.

### üß† Pull-up Wiring for Optocouplers (ASCII Illustration)

For each shutdown signal, wire like this using the device's own logic rail:

    Device 3.3V or 5V ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
                          [10kŒ©]
                            ‚îÇ
    Opto Collector ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ GPIO Pin
                            ‚îÇ
                      Device GND

- The **resistor pulls the signal HIGH** when the optocoupler is not conducting
- When accessory power is cut, the opto **pulls the GPIO LOW**, triggering shutdown
- Use the **same voltage rail and ground** from the device receiving the signal

## ‚öôÔ∏è Behavior Summary

- When the vehicle turns ON (ACC = 12V):
  - The Smart Power Hub detects accessory power via VIN_ACC
  - The XY-J02 relay activates, passing 12V Constant through a fuse and buck converter
  - The connected device(s) power on via VOUT_5V or VOUT_12V_SW

- While the vehicle is running:
  - GPIO shutdown lines (e.g., SIG_SHUT_3V3, SIG_SHUT_5V) remain HIGH via opto-isolated pull-up
  - Devices operate normally

- When the vehicle turns OFF (ACC = 0V):
  - The XY-J02 relay begins its delay timer (e.g., 30‚Äì60 seconds)
  - The optocoupler detects loss of VIN_ACC and pulls the shutdown signal LOW
  - Devices detect the falling edge and begin clean shutdown
  - After the delay, power is cut via the relay

- The inline rocker switch (SW_KILL) can manually disconnect VIN_CONST, disabling the system entirely

> üîÑ This flow ensures a clean, timed shutdown without corrupting storage or requiring additional power logic in each connected device.

## Shutdown Script (Python Example)

```python
# shutdown_trigger.py
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import os
import time

SHUTDOWN_PIN = 17

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(SHUTDOWN_PIN, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_UP)

try:
    GPIO.wait_for_edge(SHUTDOWN_PIN, GPIO.FALLING)
    os.system("sudo shutdown -h now")
except:
    pass
finally:
    GPIO.cleanup()
```

- Run at boot using `rc.local`, `cron`, or a `systemd` service.

---

## üìù Notes

- Always fuse both `VIN_CONST` and `VIN_ACC` inputs for safety
- Recommended delay for the XY-J02 is **30‚Äì60 seconds** to ensure clean shutdown
- Ensure the buck converter is rated for **at least 3A** to power the Pi and peripherals
- Simulate ACC loss during testing to verify full shutdown timing and GPIO behavior
- Use **optocouplers** for reliable and isolated GPIO signal detection (recommended over pull-up/down resistors alone)
- Optional: log shutdown events or power transitions for diagnostics and reliability tracking
