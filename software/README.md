# üß† Software Modules

This folder contains the software that powers each major subsystem of DashForge. Each subfolder represents a dedicated role for a Raspberry Pi or shared code used across modules.

## üìÅ Modules

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`dash/`](./dash/README.md) | Reads OBDII data from the vehicle and displays it on-screen in a custom dashboard interface. Connects to an ELM327 Bluetooth adapter. |

## üîß Environment

- Primary language(s): Python, Shell, and potentially Node.js/C++
- Will use local `.env` or shared config files from `shared/`
- Optional use of `systemd` or `cron` to manage module startup

---

## üß™ Development Notes

- Modules are designed to run headless or with basic UI output
- All services will be built to start automatically on boot
- Networking (MQTT or socket-based) may be introduced for module-to-module communication

---

Each module contains its own `README.md` with further details and setup instructions.
